## Introduction

### Game Summary Pitch

Tiny Dungeon is an action roguelike RPG where players, solo or in a party, venture into a cursed dungeon to save a doomed village.
### Inspiration, Lufia II: Rise of the Sinistrals

| Lufia is the main inspiration for this game. Lufia is a RPG with puzzle elements, featuring the Ancient Cave, a randomly generated dungeon with 99 floors. The cave is introduced as a side quest in the town of Gruberik. Each time the player enters, a new layout is generated, similar to roguelikes.<br><br>Inside the cave, characters are reset to zero experience points and lose almost all equipment and items. The player must progress through the floors, collecting gear, discovering magic spells, and leveling up, all with the goal of reaching the final floor of the Ancient Cave. | ![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXfiKshZ51npxLnrbeKGbADiwyEXC7a8ltclNAZ6UizM9YYD2BICQZkN6UJLN3dqEQRPIHnBDBy1m9F6GEJVBseAzaO9z0CLxB85prM6-NZwC3x-SmOKgbacnCjuza8YpWVM3oRqHw?key=2i2pyTWZ-odpI0USbbU0gg)![](https://lh7-rt.googleusercontent.com/docsz/AD_4nXdqnJUndxGDmllPC8QzmmCE_xaJwgZf68nL8KB1yqknb9BgrJhisuYHrvTUTK5ceqW0bKUE-bRUFJKYXWvS4_PUSwrpQtSVdsm5tjsF8s9TJN3PFHgCc-sYEA05RGgpwp1ISdv5NQ?key=2i2pyTWZ-odpI0USbbU0gg)<br><br>Master Jelly final boss of the Ancient Cave |

## Concept

## Development Timeline

- Started at: 12:00 on Monday, 23 June 2025 
- Deadline: 12:00 on Thursday, 26 June 2025
- Approximately 72 hours or 24 work hours
### 23 June 2025 (+8 hours)

Brainstorming, Market Research & Considerations
- Focus on 2D or 2.5D/isometric visuals to cut dev time and reach casual audiences.
- Reinterpret the Title: One Mechanic, One Level as One Mech One Life (evokes a Doom-style vibe)
- Sci-fi turret/tower-defense idea
- Giant walking machines mining, upgrading weapons, fighting critters.
- Mashup: Factorio + Mortal Engines + tower defense
- Roguelike RPG concept: Dungeon of Tiny Village
- 100-floor dungeon, runs reset on death
- Single or co-op play, party revives via potions, shop-bought crystals, or ads.
- Procedural levels, fresh layouts each run
- Compressed runs (10–90 min)
- Monetization:
	- Rewarded ads for revives or temporary buffs
	- In-App Purchases (IAPs) for potions, Crystals of Immortality, cosmetics
- Copy Game Design Doc from develop.games and modify it for the current project

Initial Development
- Install Unity Hub modules: WebGL Build Support + Android Build Support
- Create a new project and configure target platforms (Android & WebGL)
- Create a quick and dirty test scene as the scaffolding for the prototype
- Browse kenney.nl (and similar) for free assets
- Run quick builds on Windows, WebGL, and Android to confirm cross-platform setup
### 24 June 2025 (+10 hours)
- File GitHub issues
- Spent ~10 min troubleshooting IntelliSense
- Install and configure the Unity Input System package
- Scaffold a basic PlayerController
- Switch public variables to private and use [SerializeField] to make them appear in the inspector.
- Removed actions such as crouch, sprint, and jump: These actions don’t significantly impact gameplay. Their removal simplifies porting to mobile. Keeping only interact, move, dash, and attack streamlines mechanics.
- Obstacle interactions: 
	- Light builds auto-jump when dashing. 
	- Heavy builds break obstacles. 
	- Mages phase through obstacles like ghosts.
- Fixed gaps between tiles using sprite atlas, resolving issues caused by unpadded textures.
- Updated the level and added a river to test the dash jump mechanic.
- Updated the player controller to dash jump over the river, but it failed. I couldn’t get the jump to form a nice arc or properly toggle the collision layers. I suspect I need to handle the colliders in 3D. specifically accounting for the player’s z-position, which would be time consuming. I’ll skip this for now.
- Implemented a dash ramming mechanic to break objects and attack enemies.
- Developed a health system.
- Created an object pool for displaying damage points.
### 25 June 2025 (+12 hours)
- Enhance game UI and menus using UI Toolkit, including sound effects
- Expand the level design
- Add breakable barrels, bombs, and area-of-effect (AOE) damage
- Implement game-over UI and reviving mechanics
- Add mobile touch input and movement controls
- Adjust player dash speed and timing
- Update the game design document
- Added version number to the UI
